# The missing README.md for ASP.NET 5

The `README.md` content was based on html welcome page that is still created and shipped with VisualStudio tooling for ASP.NET 5.
Most projects seem to use README files (like README.md supported on GitHub.com) hence this project.

The `README.md` created here is now shipping with `generator-aspnet`:

Thanks!
